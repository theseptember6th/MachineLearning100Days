    "**How to Frame a Machine Learning Problem | How to Plan a Data Science Project Effectively**\n",
    "\n",
    "The video discusses the crucial first step in any machine learning project: framing the problem effectively. It emphasizes that even if you start as a junior data scientist handling specific tasks, your growth within a company depends on your problem-solving skills. The core idea is to take a business problem and translate it into a machine learning problem that can be solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speaker uses a case study involving Netflix to illustrate this process. Imagine you are a senior data scientist at Netflix, and in a meeting, the challenge is to figure out how to increase revenue. Two primary ways to boost revenue are acquiring new customers through marketing or charging existing customers more. However, the speaker focuses on a third approach: reducing customer churn (the rate at which customers leave the platform).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing churn is identified as a significant opportunity. The speaker explains churn rate with an example: if Netflix has 100 users and a monthly churn rate of 2%, they will lose two customers that month, resulting in 98 remaining. While new customer acquisition usually offsets churn, a high churn rate can negatively impact growth. Netflix's current churn rate is mentioned as around 0.4%. The goal is set to reduce this, for example, to 3.75% or even 3.5%, highlighting that even small percentage reductions can have a massive impact given Netflix's large user base.\n",
    "\n",
    "This business objective – increasing revenue – is then translated into a mathematical problem: reducing the churn rate from 4% to a target percentage like 3.75%. This act of converting a business goal into a measurable metric is the first critical step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step involves thinking deeply about the type of problem you are trying to solve. This requires considering the \"big picture\" and the desired end product. In this churn reduction scenario, the ultimate goal isn't just to predict churn; it's to prevent customers from leaving. Therefore, the immediate task becomes identifying which customers are likely to churn. This initially seems like a classification problem (will a customer churn: yes or no?).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a discussion with a colleague introduces a nuance. Not all customers who are likely to churn are equally certain about leaving. Some might be on the verge, while others are only slightly inclined to cancel. Treating everyone the same and offering the same discount might be inefficient and costly. This leads to a shift in thinking: instead of just predicting *if* a customer will churn, the goal becomes predicting the *likelihood* or *propensity* of a customer to churn. This transforms the problem from a classification task to a regression task, where the output is a score between 0 and 100% representing the probability of churn. Customers with higher scores could then be offered more significant incentives to stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speaker emphasizes that this detailed thought process is crucial and reflects the actual work done at companies like Netflix. The identified problem type is a regression problem where the output for each customer is their churn probability, which then informs the discount offered. Simultaneously, the team would work on longer-term solutions to improve content and pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third step involves investigating if any existing solutions are available. In the Netflix example, there might be existing models that predict churn rates with a certain accuracy. Even if a complete solution isn't there, understanding what others have done and the factors they considered can provide valuable inspiration and save you from starting from scratch. You might even consult with the teams that built these existing solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth crucial step is determining the data sources and the specific data needed. This requires significant thought about what features might indicate a customer's likelihood to churn. Examples of potentially relevant data points include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Watch time: How many hours did a user spend on Netflix in the past month?\n",
    "* Browsing time vs. watching time: A high browsing-to-watching ratio might suggest difficulty finding desired content.\n",
    "* Search queries and results: Frequent searches with no results could indicate dissatisfaction with the available library.\n",
    "* Partial viewing: How often does a user start watching something and then stop midway, suggesting unengaging content?\n",
    "* Recommendation clicks: How often do users interact with the recommendations provided?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these potential features are identified, the next step is to collaborate with data engineers. Data engineers are essential for extracting this data from Netflix's databases and creating a data warehouse containing the necessary columns for each customer. This highlights that a data scientist often relies on the expertise of others to access and prepare the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth step is defining the metrics to measure the success of your model. This involves determining how you will know if your churn reduction efforts are working. Metrics could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The difference between the predicted churn rate and the actual churn rate.\n",
    "* Whether the customers predicted to churn are indeed the ones who end up leaving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining these metrics early on is crucial for guiding your work and assessing its effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sixth consideration involves deciding between online learning and batch learning for your model. Batch learning involves training the model periodically with a fresh dataset. Online learning entails continuously updating the model with new data in real-time. Given the potentially volatile nature of viewing habits (influenced by factors like lockdowns, holidays, and content releases), online learning might seem beneficial for Netflix. However, the speaker notes that with the current data infrastructure, online training might be difficult, so a decision might be made to retrain the model offline weekly and then deploy the updated model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step discussed is making assumptions. As a data scientist, you need to make certain assumptions and then validate them. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature availability: Are the data points you identified actually available and reliably recorded? This requires discussion with data engineering.\n",
    "* Model generalizability: If you train a model based on data from one region (e.g., the US), will it perform equally well in other regions (e.g., India)? You might need to consider building separate models for different geographies or other segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speaker concludes by emphasizing that a significant portion of a data scientist's work, especially at a senior level, involves this kind of strategic thinking and problem framing *before* any coding begins. Rushing into coding without a clear understanding of the problem and a well-thought-out plan can lead to costly mistakes and wasted effort, especially in large organizations. The ability to think through problems systematically and demonstrate leadership in this way is what differentiates those who progress in their data science careers. The video encourages viewers to not just learn machine learning techniques but also to develop into thoughtful and effective data scientists."
