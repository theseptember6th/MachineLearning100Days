    "### üìå **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This video is the first in a series focused on **Understanding Your Data**, an essential step before any Machine Learning modeling begins. It highlights the basic questions to ask when you first receive a dataset and how to extract meaningful insights using Python (especially with Pandas).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç **Why Understanding Data is Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into machine learning models, it's critical to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Know what your data represents.\n",
    "* Clean and prepare your dataset.\n",
    "* Reduce memory usage.\n",
    "* Handle missing values.\n",
    "* Understand the distribution and type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps avoid incorrect assumptions, improves model accuracy, and ensures efficient computation.\n",

    "## üî¢ **Basic Questions to Ask When You Receive a Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. How Big is the Data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal**: Find out the **number of rows and columns** in the dataset.\n",
    "* **Why**: Knowing the size helps decide:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * How much memory it might need.\n",
    "  * Whether it can be loaded into memory all at once.\n",
    "* **How**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  df.shape\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `.shape` returns a tuple `(rows, columns)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. What Does the Data Look Like?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal**: Get a glimpse of how the data is structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Two methods**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **a) `df.head()`**: Shows the first 5 rows by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  df.head()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **b) `df.sample(n)`**: Shows `n` random rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  df.sample(5)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why Random Samples?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Sometimes, the first few rows are **structured or biased**.\n",
    "  * Random rows give a **more holistic** idea of the dataset.\n",
    "  * Avoid misinterpretation caused by initial patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. What is the Data Type of Each Column?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why Important**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data types affect **memory usage** and **model behavior**.\n",
    "  * Helps you know which columns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Categorical (`object`)\n",
    "    * Numerical (`int`, `float`)\n",
    "    * Boolean, etc.\n",
    "* **How**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  df.info()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Column names\n",
    "    * Non-null values\n",
    "    * Data types\n",
    "    * Memory usage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Optimization Tip:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes **numerical columns are stored as floats** unnecessarily.\n",
    "* If all values are whole numbers, consider converting to `int` to save memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['Age'] = df['Age'].astype('int')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially important in large datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **4. Are There Any Missing Values?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Missing values can break ML models.\n",
    "  * You need to decide whether to **fill** (impute) or **drop** missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How to Detect**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **a) Use `df.info()`**: Gives a rough idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **b) Use this code for a detailed count**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  df.isnull().sum()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **This command returns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Column-wise count of missing values.\n",
    "  * Helps identify:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Columns that can be dropped.\n",
    "    * Columns that require imputation.\n",
