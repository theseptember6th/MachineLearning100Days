    "### Working with JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is JSON?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.\n",
    "* It's a universal data format, meaning almost all programming languages can understand it.\n",
    "* It's particularly important when dealing with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).\n",
    "* When you make a request to an API, the response often comes in JSON format.\n",
    "* This JSON format can then be parsed and used by various programming languages like Java, Python, and others.\n",
    "* JSON is a very popular data format in general.\n",
    "* You might encounter datasets in JSON format on platforms like Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading JSON Data with Pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To work with JSON data in Python, you'll typically use the Pandas library.\n",
    "* Import Pandas:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* Pandas provides a function `read_json()` that works similarly to `read_csv()`.\n",
    "* To read a JSON file into a Pandas DataFrame, you simply provide the file path to `read_json()`:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    df = pd.read_json('your_file.json')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* The example used a `recipes.json` file. The resulting DataFrame had columns like 'cuisine' and 'ingredients' (which was a list within each row).\n",
    "* The initial DataFrame had around 39,000 rows (representing different dishes) and 3 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`pd.read_json()` Options**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `read_json()` function has various options, similar to `read_csv()`.\n",
    "* **`dtype`**: To specify data types for columns.\n",
    "* **`encoding`**: To handle different file encodings (e.g., 'utf-8').\n",
    "* **`chunksize`**: To load large JSON files in chunks to manage memory usage.\n",
    "* **`nrows`**: To load only a specific number of rows from the JSON file.\n",
    "* Refer to the Pandas documentation for a complete list of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading JSON Data from a URL**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pd.read_json()` can also read JSON data directly from a URL.\n",
    "* Simply pass the URL of the JSON endpoint to the function:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    url = 'your_json_url'\n",
    "    df = pd.read_json(url)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* The example demonstrated fetching currency exchange rate data in JSON format from a public API and converting it into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "* Pandas automatically handles the JSON parsing from the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is SQL?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQL stands for Structured Query Language.\n",
    "* It's used to interact with databases.\n",
    "* With SQL, you can directly retrieve data from a database for analysis in Python.\n",
    "* SQL is a very common format for data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "* You'll likely encounter datasets in SQL database format on platforms like Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting up a Local SQL Database (using XAMPP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To work with the provided `world.sql` dataset, a local SQL database needs to be set up.\n",
    "* XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution that includes MySQL (a popular database system).\n",
    "* **Installation:** Download and install XAMPP.\n",
    "* **Starting Services:** Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the \"Apache\" (web server) and \"MySQL\" (database server) services.\n",
    "* **Accessing phpMyAdmin:** Open a web browser and go to `localhost/phpmyadmin`. This is a web interface for managing your MySQL database.\n",
    "* **Creating a Database:** In phpMyAdmin, create a new database (e.g., named 'world').\n",
    "* **Importing the SQL File:** Select the newly created database, go to the \"Import\" tab, choose the `world.sql` file, and click \"Go\". This will execute the SQL script and create tables within your 'world' database.\n",
    "* The `world.sql` file in the example created three tables: 'city', 'country', and 'countrylanguage'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connecting Python to MySQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To interact with the MySQL database from Python, you need a connector library.\n",
    "* **`mysql.connector`**: This is a common Python library for connecting to MySQL databases.\n",
    "* **Installation:** Install the library using pip:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install mysql-connector-python\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Importing the Library:** In your Python script, import the library:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import mysql.connector\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Creating a Connection:** Establish a connection to the database using `mysql.connector.connect()`:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "      host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "      user=\"root\",\n",
    "      password=\"\",\n",
    "      database=\"world\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    * `host`: The IP address of the database server (usually \"localhost\" for a local setup).\n",
    "    * `user`: The username for the database (default is often \"root\" with XAMPP).\n",
    "    * `password`: The password for the database (often empty by default with XAMPP).\n",
    "    * `database`: The name of the database you want to connect to.\n",
    "* The `mydb` variable now holds a connection object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading SQL Data with Pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas provides a convenient function `read_sql()` to directly execute SQL queries and load the results into a DataFrame.\n",
    "* **Syntax:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    df = pd.read_sql(sql_query, connection_object)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    * `sql_query`: A string containing the SQL query you want to execute (e.g., `SELECT * FROM city`).\n",
    "    * `connection_object`: The database connection object you created (e.g., `mydb`).\n",
    "* **Example 1: Reading the entire 'city' table:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    query = \"SELECT * FROM city\"\n",
    "    city_df = pd.read_sql(query, mydb)\n",
    "    print(city_df.head())\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Example 2: Filtering data using a `WHERE` clause:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    query = \"SELECT * FROM city WHERE CountryCode = 'IND'\"\n",
    "    indian_cities_df = pd.read_sql(query, mydb)\n",
    "    print(indian_cities_df.head())\n",
    "\n",
    "    query_usa = \"SELECT * FROM city WHERE CountryCode = 'USA'\"\n",
    "    usa_cities_df = pd.read_sql(query_usa, mydb)\n",
    "    print(usa_cities_df.head())\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Example 3: Reading the 'country' table:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    query_country = \"SELECT * FROM country\"\n",
    "    country_df = pd.read_sql(query_country, mydb)\n",
    "    print(country_df.head())\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Example 4: Filtering based on a numerical condition:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    query_life_expectancy = \"SELECT * FROM country WHERE LifeExpectancy > 60\"\n",
    "    high_life_expectancy_df = pd.read_sql(query_life_expectancy, mydb)\n",
    "    print(high_life_expectancy_df.head())\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* You can use any valid SQL query with `pd.read_sql()` to retrieve and manipulate data directly into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`pd.read_sql()` Options**\n",
    "\n",
    "* While the video mentioned fewer options compared to `read_json()`, `read_sql()` does have some useful parameters.\n",
    "* **`index_col`**: To specify a column in the SQL result to be used as the DataFrame index.\n",
    "* **`coerce_float`**: To attempt to convert values to non-string, non-numeric objects (like decimal.Decimal) to floating point.\n",
    "* **`params`**: To pass parameters to the SQL query (for security and efficiency).\n",
    "* **`chunksize`**: Similar to `read_json()`, to retrieve data in chunks.\n",
    "* Refer to the Pandas documentation for a comprehensive list of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "* This session covered how to work with data in JSON and SQL formats using the Pandas library in Python.\n",
    "* `pd.read_json()` simplifies reading JSON data from files and URLs.\n",
    "* `pd.read_sql()` allows you to execute SQL queries against a database and directly load the results into DataFrames, bridging the gap between your database and your Python data analysis workflow.\n",
    "* Experimenting with the documentation and different datasets is encouraged to further solidify your understanding."
