    "## 🧠 **Types of Machine Learning – In Depth for Beginners**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) can be classified into types based on how much supervision (external input or labeled data) is required during the learning process. Based on this, we categorize ML algorithms into **four main types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 1. **Supervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 What is Supervised Learning?\n",
    "In supervised learning, the machine is **trained using labeled data**, meaning:\n",
    "- **Input** and **corresponding output** are both provided.\n",
    "- The system learns to **map inputs to outputs** by identifying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "Imagine a dataset of students where each record includes:\n",
    "- **IQ** (Input 1)\n",
    "- **CGPA** (Input 2)\n",
    "- **Placement status: Yes/No** (Output)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ML algorithm learns the relationship between IQ/CGPA and whether the student got placed. Later, for a new student with unknown placement status, the model can predict whether they are likely to be placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Use Case:\n",
    "Useful when:\n",
    "- You want the system to predict future outcomes based on past labeled data.\n",
    "- You have **complete datasets** with correct answers (labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 Supervised Learning is further divided into two subtypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 a) **Regression**\n",
    "- **Output** is **numerical** (continuous values).\n",
    "- Goal: Predict a quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Example:\n",
    "Predicting salary package based on IQ and CGPA:\n",
    "- Inputs: IQ = 111, CGPA = 8.9\n",
    "- Output: Package = ₹4.5 LPA\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here, the output is a number → it's a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 b) **Classification**\n",
    "- **Output** is **categorical** (discrete labels like Yes/No, Male/Female, etc.).\n",
    "- Goal: Predict which category a data point belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Example:\n",
    "Predicting if a student will get placed:\n",
    "- Output: \"Yes\" or \"No\" → it’s a classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Summary of Supervised Learning:\n",
    "| Input Data | Output Data | Type of Problem |\n",
    "|------------|-------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| Numerical + Output (Numerical) | Regression |\n",
    "| Numerical + Output (Categorical) | Classification |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 2. **Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 What is Unsupervised Learning?\n",
    "- You are given **only input data**, with **no corresponding output**.\n",
    "- The algorithm must find hidden patterns or structures in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Goal:\n",
    "- Group similar data points.\n",
    "- Reduce dimensionality.\n",
    "- Find relationships within data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "You have customer data (age, income, spending habits) but no labels like “high spender” or “low spender.”\n",
    "The algorithm groups customers based on behavior — this is **clustering**, a type of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Subtypes of Unsupervised Learning:\n",
    "1. **Clustering** – Grouping similar data points together.\n",
    "2. **Association** – Finding relationships between variables (e.g., market basket analysis: customers who buy X also buy Y).\n",
    "3. **Dimensionality Reduction** – Reducing data features while preserving important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 What is it?\n",
    "- A mix of **labeled and unlabeled data**.\n",
    "- You provide some data with outputs, and some without.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Goal:\n",
    "- Use the small amount of labeled data to guide learning on a larger unlabeled dataset.\n",
    "- Common in real-world scenarios where labeling is expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 4. **Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 What is it?\n",
    "- The machine learns by **interacting with an environment**.\n",
    "- It receives **rewards or penalties** based on its actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Goal:\n",
    "- Maximize cumulative reward over time.\n",
    "- It’s like training a pet: do a good job → get a treat; do poorly → no reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "Training an AI agent to play a game:\n",
    "- Actions → Move left, right, jump.\n",
    "- Reward → Score points or win.\n",
    "- Penalty → Lose points or die.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧾 Final Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Labeled Data | Goal | Examples |\n",
    "|------|--------------|------|----------|\n",
    "| Supervised | ✅ Yes | Predict Output | Classification, Regression |\n",
    "| Unsupervised | ❌ No | Discover Patterns | Clustering, Association |\n",
    "| Semi-Supervised | ✅ Partial | Improve Learning | Large image datasets with few labels |\n",
    "| Reinforcement | ❌ No (direct labels) | Learn through trial & error | Robotics, Game AI |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Quick Tip to Identify the Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Are both input and output available?**\n",
    "  - Yes → Supervised\n",
    "    - Output is a **number** → Regression\n",
    "    - Output is a **label** → Classification\n",
    "- **Only input available?**\n",
    "  - Yes → Unsupervised\n",
    "- **Some labeled + many unlabeled data?**\n",
    "  - Yes → Semi-Supervised\n",
    "- **Is the model learning from interaction & rewards?**\n",
    "  - Yes → Reinforcement Learning\n",
