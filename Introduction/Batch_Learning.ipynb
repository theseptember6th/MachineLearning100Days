    "### 📌 Introduction\n",
    "The video discusses an **alternative way to classify Machine Learning (ML)** algorithms based on **how they are trained**, rather than how they are supervised (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification includes:\n",
    "- **Batch Learning (Offline Learning)**\n",
    "- **Online Learning**\n",

    "## 📊 Production vs Development in ML\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Development Environment:\n",
    "- Where models are **built and trained** (usually on a local machine).\n",
    "- Data scientists and ML engineers develop and test the model here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Production Environment:\n",
    "- The final, trained model is **deployed on a server**.\n",
    "- The server is accessible via IP address for real users.\n",
    "- This environment serves **real-time predictions or recommendations**.\n",

    "## 1️⃣ **Batch Learning (a.k.a. Offline Learning)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Definition:\n",
    "Batch Learning is the **traditional method** of ML model training where:\n",
    "- The entire dataset is used **at once** to train the model.\n",
    "- No incremental or continuous learning occurs after deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- Model is trained **offline** using all the available historical data.\n",
    "- Once trained, the model is **fixed (static)**.\n",
    "- To improve or update, the model must be **re-trained from scratch** with new + old data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 Process Overview:\n",
    "1. **Gather data**\n",
    "2. **Train model** with the full dataset\n",
    "3. **Test the model**\n",
    "4. **Deploy the model to production**\n",
    "5. **Model remains fixed** until next manual update\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Limitation:\n",
    "- The model **does not adapt** to new data or changes in user behavior until it's retrained.\n",
    "- As time passes, the model might become **outdated** due to:\n",
    "  - Changes in market conditions\n",
    "  - New user trends\n",
    "  - Evolving data distributions (concept drift)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📉 Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Cannot adapt to real-time data.\n",
    "- Re-training is **resource-intensive and time-consuming**.\n",
    "- Difficult to handle **very large datasets**.\n",
    "- High **cost of storage and computation** for retraining.\n",
