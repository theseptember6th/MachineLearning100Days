    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.\n",
    "- The goal is to create systems that can think, reason, and solve problems like humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- AI is the **broadest field**.\n",
    "- It includes everything from rule-based systems to advanced learning algorithms.\n",
    "- AI can be **symbolic (rule-based)** or **learning-based**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa.\n",
    "- Recommendation systems on YouTube and Netflix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of AI:**\n",
    "- **Narrow AI**: Performs a specific task (e.g., image recognition).\n",
    "- **General AI**: Hypothetical ‚Äì would match human intelligence.\n",
    "- **Super AI**: Surpasses human intelligence ‚Äì still a concept, not reality.\n",

    "### üîπ 2. **What is ML (Machine Learning)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- ML is a **subset of AI** that allows machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Idea:**\n",
    "- Instead of writing rules manually, machines learn **patterns** and **rules** from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- You feed data and labels to the model.\n",
    "- The model learns the underlying patterns.\n",
    "- You don‚Äôt write explicit logic ‚Äì the model derives it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-Life Example:**\n",
    "- Showing many dog and non-dog images to a system.\n",
    "- It learns to distinguish between dogs and not-dogs on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of ML:**\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning** (with labeled data)\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning** (with unlabeled data)\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning** (learning by trial and error)\n",

    "### üîπ 3. **What is DL (Deep Learning)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- DL is a **subset of ML** that uses **neural networks with multiple layers** (deep neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inspired By:**\n",
    "- Structure of the human brain (neurons and synapses).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Automatically extracts complex features from raw data.\n",
    "- Best suited for large datasets and high-performance hardware (like GPUs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "- Image recognition (e.g., face recognition)\n",
    "- Voice recognition (e.g., Google Voice)\n",
    "- Natural Language Processing (e.g., ChatGPT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Feeding thousands of labeled images of dogs.\n",
    "- The system learns to classify based on features like shape, size, color, etc.\n",
