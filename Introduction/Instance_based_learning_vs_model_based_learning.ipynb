    "\n",
    "This video is a part of a series on **types of machine learning**, but focuses specifically on **how machine learning models learn** ‚Äî i.e., **their learning mechanism**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While previous discussions might have covered:\n",
    "- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "- How models are trained and updated\n",
    "\n",
    "This video focuses on another classification:\n",
    "> **\"How a model learns from data\"**, which is what distinguishes **Instance-Based Learning** and **Model-Based Learning**.\n",

    "## ‚ú® Introduction: Human Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into machine learning, the speaker draws a comparison with how **humans learn**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some students **memorize answers** without understanding.\n",
    "- Others **understand the concept** and solve problems by applying logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, ML models have **two broad ways of learning**:\n",
    "1. **Instance-Based Learning** (memorization-style)\n",
    "2. **Model-Based Learning** (understanding patterns/principles)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß© 1. What is **Instance-Based Learning**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also called:\n",
    "- **Lazy Learning**\n",
    "- **Memory-based learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition**: Models that **memorize the training data** and make predictions by comparing new inputs to previously seen examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- No learning happens **until** a prediction is needed.\n",
    "- The model stores the **entire training dataset**.\n",
    "- It finds the **closest matching examples** to the new data point.\n",
    "- Decisions are made **at inference time**, not during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß™ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "| IQ   | CGPA | Placement |\n",
    "|------|------|-----------|\n",
    "| 188  | 7.2  | Yes       |\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Problem**: Given a new student's IQ and CGPA, will they get placed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Approach:\n",
    "- Use a distance-based method like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.\n",
    "- Compute **similarity/distance** to all stored points.\n",
    "- Take a vote from the **k nearest neighbors**.\n",
    "- Predict based on majority class among neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ùó Important Note:\n",
    "> No model is ‚Äútrained‚Äù ‚Äî the training data is simply stored and used at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìâ Pros:\n",
    "- Simple and intuitive\n",
    "- No complex training phase\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:\n",
    "- High **storage** and **computation** cost at prediction time\n",
    "- **Slow** for large datasets\n",
    "- May **overfit** if data is noisy\n",

    "## üß† 2. What is **Model-Based Learning**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also called:\n",
    "- **Eager Learning**\n",
    "- **Generalization-based learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition**: Models that learn a **mathematical model/function** from the training data, capturing underlying **patterns** or **rules**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- Model tries to **understand** and **generalize** from training data.\n",
    "- It learns a **boundary or function** that separates or predicts output.\n",
    "- After training, the model can make predictions **quickly**.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Problem**: Predict for a new student based on trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Approach:\n",
    "- Use algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **SVM**, or **Neural Networks**.\n",
    "- During training, the model **creates a function or boundary** based on data points.\n",
    "- This function is then used to **predict future outcomes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìâ Pros:\n",
    "- **Fast predictions** once trained\n",
    "- Compact model (no need to store entire training data)\n",
    "- Better **generalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:\n",
