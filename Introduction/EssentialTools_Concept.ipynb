    "    * They ensure reproducibility by maintaining a specific set of packages for each project.\n",
    "    * Deployment becomes cleaner as only the necessary libraries for a project are included.\n",
    "* **Creating a Virtual Environment using Conda:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Open the Anaconda Prompt or terminal.\n",
    "    * Use the command: `conda create --name <environment_name>` (e.g., `conda create --name campus_env`). Conda will ask for confirmation before proceeding with the creation.\n",
    "* **Activating an Environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use the command: `conda activate <environment_name>` (e.g., `conda activate campus_env`). The name of the active environment will appear in parentheses at the beginning of your prompt.\n",
    "* **Installing Packages within an Environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Once an environment is activated, you can install specific packages needed for your project using `conda install <package_name>` (e.g., `conda install jupyter`) or `pip install <package_name>` (e.g., `pip install numpy`).\n",
    "    * The video demonstrates installing Jupyter Notebook within the newly created environment and then NumPy.\n",
    "* **Deactivating an Environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use the command: `conda deactivate`. This will return you to the base or default Anaconda environment.\n",
    "* **Removing an Environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use the command: `conda remove --name <environment_name> --all` (e.g., `conda remove --name campus_env --all`). Conda will list the packages to be removed and ask for confirmation.\n",
