    "## 🔹 **Online Machine Learning (OLM) - Study Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 **Definition**\n",
    "- **Online Machine Learning** is a subfield of machine learning where:\n",
    "  - The model is trained incrementally.\n",
    "  - Data is fed in **small batches** (often one sample at a time).\n",
    "  - Learning and updating happen **continuously** as new data arrives.\n",
    "  - Unlike **offline learning**, where the model is trained on a static dataset all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Concept Explained Simply**\n",
    "- Imagine a model that **learns while deployed**.\n",
    "- Every time new data is observed, it uses that to:\n",
    "  - **Predict** outputs.\n",
    "  - **Update** itself to perform better next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 📌 **Key Characteristics of Online Learning**\n",
    "1. **Incremental Learning**:\n",
    "   - Model trains step-by-step on small chunks.\n",
    "   - Learns from **live data** continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-time Updates**:\n",
    "   - No need to retrain from scratch.\n",
    "   - Just keep updating as data flows in.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Efficient**:\n",
    "   - Saves **time** and **computational cost**.\n",
    "   - Suitable for **large-scale systems**.\n",

    "| Feature | Online Learning | Offline Learning |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| Data Input | Continuous / Streaming | Static Dataset |\n",
    "| Model Update | After each data point | After all data is available |\n",
    "| Cost | Less (small data chunks) | More (training entire dataset) |\n",
    "| Use-case | Real-time systems | Batch tasks |\n",
    "| Flexibility | Highly adaptable | Rigid after training |\n",

    "### 🔁 **How Online Learning Works**\n",
    "1. Start with a **small initial dataset**.\n",
    "2. Train a **basic model** on it.\n",
    "3. Deploy the model to a **live environment**.\n",
    "4. As **new data** is generated:\n",
    "   - Model **predicts outputs**.\n",
    "   - **Retrains itself** using the new data.\n",
    "   - Performance improves gradually.\n",

    "   - Learn language patterns dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SwiftKey Keyboard (Android)**:\n",
    "   - Learns typing behavior.\n",
    "   - Suggests words more accurately over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **YouTube Recommendations**:\n",
    "   - Recommends videos based on real-time click behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **E-commerce (Amazon, Flipkart)**:\n",
    "   - Suggests products based on recent browsing and purchase activity.\n",

    "- You have **streaming data** (e.g., Twitter feed).\n",
    "- The **problem is dynamic** (customer behavior changes).\n",
    "- You need to save **memory and computation**.\n",
    "- **Fast predictions** and **model updates** are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📉 Concept Drift:\n",
    "- Happens when the underlying pattern in the data changes over time.\n",
    "- Online learning helps the model **stay updated** with new trends.\n",
